[Data scraping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_scraping) (also known as web scraping) is the process of extracting datasets from information on websites.

A common starting point for any data-driven project is the search for good data. There are two traditional approaches to gaining access to data:

| Option                                              | Pros                | Cons                                                         |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1. Buy a dataset from a vendor.                     | - High quality data | - Expensive                                                  |
| 2. Wait for a dataset to become publicly available. | - Cheap/Free        | - Unknown timeline                                           |
| 3. Generate your own dataset.                       | - Cheap/Free        | - Requires effort<br />- Limited to what is available on the web |

In this article, I will propose the use of Github Actions to assist in option 3.
